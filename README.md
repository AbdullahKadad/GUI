# Graphical User Interface

Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a user-friendly visual interface that allows users to interact with software through graphical elements such as windows, 
icons, buttons, and menus, instead of text-based commands.

## Tkinter

- Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. It provides a powerful object-oriented interface to create graphical user interfaces.
- Tkinter is included with the standard Python distribution, so it does not require any additional installation.

## Grid manager

The grid geometry manager in Tkinter allows you to place widgets in a table-like structure, 
defined by rows and columns. 
This can provide more control over widget placement.
